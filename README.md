# Library Management System (Python – Terminal Based)

This project is a simple terminal-based Library Management System written in Python. It was developed as my Class 12 Computer Science board project to practice and demonstrate fundamental Python concepts, including lists, dictionaries, procedural programming, and basic data handling without using external libraries or databases.

The objective of this project was to validate my understanding of Python basics and apply them in a real program that performs meaningful operations with user interaction.

# Features

The system supports the following operations:

Add books to the library

Register new members

Issue books to members

Return issued books

Check availability of a specific book

Display all books

Display all registered members

All records are stored in runtime using Python lists and dictionaries.

# Technologies Used

Python (Core)

Lists, Dictionaries

Procedural Programming

Basic input/output

Loop and conditional statements

No external libraries or databases are used.

# How the Logic Works

Books and members are stored in Python lists.

Borrowed books are tracked using a dictionary that maps member IDs to a list of issued book IDs.

Issuing a book reduces quantity.

Returning a book increases quantity.

All functionality is driven through a simple menu loop in the console.

# How to Run

Make sure Python is installed on your system.

Download or clone this repository.

Open a terminal/command prompt inside the project folder.

Run the script using:

        python library_management.py


# Project Purpose

This project was created as part of my Class 12 Computer Science board assignment. The goal was to implement a small working application using only Python fundamentals and to ensure that my basics (such as functions, control flow, lists, and dictionaries) were thoroughly understood and applied.

# Future Improvements

Possible enhancements include:

Adding file/database storage

Adding a GUI (Tkinter)

Preventing duplicate entries

Searching by title or author
